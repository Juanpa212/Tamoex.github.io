                    <h3>Intel vs AMD</h3>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to variety AMD is better than Intel. With far more efficent processors
                        and not to mention cheaper, AMD is the better option if you are on a budget. However,
                        Intel is the clear winner when it comes to raw power.

                    <h3>Nvidia vs AMD</h3>
                    <P>
                        When it comes to graphics cards there are two main competitors, Nvidia and AMD. 
                        Nvidia is the more popular of the two and is the one that is used in most gaming
                        pcs. AMD is the less popular of the two and is the one that is used in most prebuilt
                        pcs. Both are good options, but Nvidia is the better option if you are a gamer.
                    </P>
                    <h3>Solid State Drive vs Hard Drive</h3>
                    <p>
                        When it comes to read and write speeds the SSD takes the cake. However, SSDs are more expensive
                        than hard drives. A hard drive is a good option if you are on a budget, but if you have the money
                        to spend, an SSD is the way to go.

                        Note: There are external options that can be purchased in local retailers. These options are like 
                        pen drives but on steroids. They connect via USB and can be used to store files. though again the 
                        tend to be more expensive than the ladder.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Atx vs MicroAtx</h3>
                    <p>
                        These are the two most common types of motherboards. The difference between the two is the size. The Atx
                        is the bigger of the two and the MicroAtx is the smaller of the two. The Atx is the more common of the two
                        and is the one that is used in most gaming pcs. The MicroAtx is the smaller of the two and is used in smaller
                        pcs. The MicroAtx is the one that is used in most prebuilt pcs.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Air Cooling vs Water Cooling vs Custom Loop</h3>
                    <p>
                        Air cooling is the cheaper option most of the time and when running lower power componets its a good option.
                        However, when running higher power components, you would need to swap to a water cooling system or custom loop.
                        These systems are more expensive, but they are more efficent at cooling higher power components. Custom loops
                        are a more advance option that can be scary at first but it delivers the best results and by far the best looks.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Add-ons</h3>
                    <p>
                        These are the components that are not crucial to the performance of your pc, but they are nice to have. A dvd
                        drive is a good option if you have a lot of dvd discs. A sound card is a good option if you are an audiophile.
                        A wifi card is a good option if you do not have an ethernet cable. RGB lights are a good option if you want your
                        pc to look cool.
                    </p>
