                        <p>My name is <em>Juan M. Pabon Del Valle </em> and I study computer engineering
                            at the <em>Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico</em>. I'm in a junior and 
                            love learning about coding languages and how each of them differ in
                            use cases.</p>
                        
                        <p>My goal as a programmer is to make safe and easy to 
                            pick up products, that any one can enjoy and better 
                            their productivity needs. I strive to learn all i 
                            can and better my understanding and skills as a programmer
                            to insure i can become a useful add on to any team.

                        <p>After University i plan to move to the states to look for better
                            work opportunities so i can provide for my family and earn a honest
                            living by making the customers life easier with the projects that i 
                            create.
